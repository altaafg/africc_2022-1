# Program to perform basic calculator functions
# Variables are A for control, x and y to hold raw numbers and z to hold the result.
# Strings are B for control and calculation to calculate

# Declaring the variables
A=0
B="y"
x=0
y=0
z=0
calculator="yes"

# Defining the functions for the calculations to be carried out
def addition (): #function for addition
  z = int(x) +int(y)
  print("The answer is:", z)

def subtraction (): #function for subtraction
    z = int(x) - int(y)

def multiplication (): #function for multiplication
    z = int(x) * int(y)

def division (): #function for division
    z = int(x) / int(y)
